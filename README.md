# CS50 Web Programming

This is my solution for Harvard University's CS50 Web Programming course. The course focuses on the in-depth design and implementation of web applications using Python, JavaScript, and SQL. It covers frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.

## Project Details

The goal of the course is to build web applications with modern web technologies. I have completed several projects that explore different aspects of web development, from backend logic with Python and Django to frontend interfaces with React and Bootstrap.
